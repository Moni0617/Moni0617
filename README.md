# 👋 Hi, I’m Mounika  
### 🚀 SRE Leader | AI + Reliability Engineering | AIOps | Platform Intelligence  

I’m an engineering leader with 9+ years of experience designing, scaling, and operating **highly reliable, cloud-native systems** — now pioneering the next evolution of reliability through **AI + Site Reliability Engineering (AI-SRE)**.

I specialize in **SRE, Platform Engineering, and AIOps**, blending **machine learning, observability, and automation** to create **self-healing, predictive, and adaptive systems**.  
My mission: build intelligent reliability platforms that can **learn, detect, and recover autonomously**.
